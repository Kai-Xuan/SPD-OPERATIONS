Compute Local Difference Vectors via four metrics on the Symmetric Positive Definite(SPD) manifold.  
(https://github.com/Kai-Xuan/MyNote/tree/master/ML/SPD-LDV)  
Four metrics:  
1.Affine Invariant Riemannian Metric(AIRM),  
2.Stein divergence,  
3.Jeffrey divergence,  
4.Log-Euclidean Metric(LEM).  

For x,y in Euclidean space, the LDV is computed by : y - x. Here we compute LDV on the SPD manifold.
